    <h1>The Rules</h1>
    <p class="lead">Please note these are still Work in Progress and unfinalised. They are subject to change.</p>
    <h2>General Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>This is a community server. Please do not contact Gareth Dennis over any issues you have here.</b></li>
      <li>
        <p><b>THE “BIGOTS AND BULLIES CAN GTFO” RULE</b></p>
        <p>Any racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, ableism, hate speech of any kind or language that
          makes another user feel unsafe will immediately result in ADMIN ACTION.</p>
        <p>Irony/memes/jokes that comprise hate speech are still hate speech, and will also result in ADMIN ACTION.
          Links to websites that are known to be generally hateful or are right-wing mouthpieces will result in ADMIN
          ACTION.</p>
        <p>If you are known to be or can be shown to be a bigot elsewhere, you will also likely receive ADMIN ACTION.
        </p>
        <p>Do not post threats or targeted hostility. Not to other users, not to external groups or establishments, not
          to regions of the world, not to anyone or anywhere. They will absolutely be misconstrued when not seen in the
          correct time or context and don't add anything to the conversation. Expect a prod if you do this, and ADMIN
          ACTION if you do this again.</p>
        <p><em>The same applies when it comes to in-game interactions. If you constantly target one user or a group of
            users, you will receive ADMIN ACTION.</em></p>
        <p>This is a simple enough rule – if you out yourself as a bigot or a bully, you're gone.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>THE “NO BEEF” RULE</b></p>
        <p>This is not the place to practice your debating skills – head to Twitter to engage in The Discourse™. This is
          a place for all leftist transport folks to come together as one. Loving or hating Corbyn is an irrelevance
          here – inter-left beef never got us anywhere so leave it at the door.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>THE TROLLS WON'T BE TOLERATED RULES</b></p>
        <p>If you are going troll other users, you will receive ADMIN ACTION. Trolling includes:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>TNT Cannons</li>
          <li>Messing with items</li>
          <li>Surrounding a claim with Towny</li>
          <li>Deliberately causing harm to another user's claim, builds, or attacking them inside their claim.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These definitions are flexible and it is up to the admin team to decide on a case by case basis.</p>
        <p>Admins can also add to this should they deem it to be necessary.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>THE GLITCHES/HACKS RULE</b></p>
        <p>Players caught using any sort of glitch/hack/other exploit on the server, for any kind of reason, to achieve
          any gain for them or another user, will receive ADMIN ACTION.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>THE “ADMIN ACTION” RULES</b></p>
        <p>ADMIN ACTION can and will vary. We are a group of people, and while we aim to moderate consistently, this
          won't always happen.</p>
        <p>
        <p>Most ADMIN ACTION will be a time-out - this is a relatively simple two-hour ban used to break up discourse.
         You can come back after a couple of hours, and you'll be fine.</p>
        <p>
        <p>Repeated time-outs or more extensive, more flagrant rule-breaking will result in a ban. If it's your first
          time banned, or you have a reputation of not being so bad, it'll only be for a day or so. Repeat bans will be
          longer and can result in a permanent ban.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Survival Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>This is a Survival PVP server. PVP is enabled in the wilderness.</b></li>
      <li>
        <p><b>All builds NOT claimed under a Towny Town/Nation/Outpost are fair game to all players.</b></p>
        <p><em>Public infrastructure, such as canals, roads, railways, etc., are protected from this rule as public infrastructure.</em></p>
        <p>The admin team are not responsible for you not looking after your builds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>War exceptions</b></p>
        <p>Certain exceptions will be made in a war that both sides agree to:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attacking within a claim</li>
          <li>The use of TNT cannons</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The following is <em>NOT</em> permitted:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Griefing</li>
          <li>Using a nation that is not engaged in the war to fight on your behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
